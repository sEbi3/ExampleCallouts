# What is that?
ExampleCallouts is an open source project and will remain so.
This project is there for you to see how callouts of this kind are constructed.
I will also add a few things.(Audio folder,.ini file,callouts and more)

# Installation

1. Drag and drop ExampleCallouts.dll and ExampleCallouts.pdb in GTA5/LSPDFR/Plugins
2. Start the game and test it.

# Built with

• RagePluginHook
• LSDFR

# You can upload it as your own version if:

• You are credit me.
• You did something in this Callout-Pack.
That means, that you don't just rename it and uploading it as your own.
